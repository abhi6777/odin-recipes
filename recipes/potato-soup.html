          <li>4 cups chicken stock, or enough to cover potatoes</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
          <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon dried tarragon</li>

               <h3>step 1</h3>
               <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
               <h3>step 2</h3>
               <p>Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon pieces on paper towels. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
               <h3>step 3</h3>
               <p>Cook celery and onion in the reserved bacon drippings until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
               <h3>step 4</h3>
               <p>Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Sauté for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan, and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
               <h3>step 5</h3>
               <p>Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
               <h3>step 6</h3>
               <p>Bring cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add cream mixture to the potato mixture; stir to combine.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
               <h3>step 7</h3>
               <p>Transfer about 1/2 of the soup to a blender and purée. Return to the Dutch oven. Adjust seasonings to taste.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
               <h3>step 8</h3>
               <p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
